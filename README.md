```lrc
[00:00.45] We were driving on the highway after a long day at the beach
[00:05.44] The sky looked pretty clear, so you took the top off of the Jeep
[00:10.41] And we sang all the words to our favorite songs from the seventies
[00:14.73] Serenading through the decades and the breeze
[00:20.26] And up ahead, the sky turned red, and then it fades to gray
[00:25.15] We can't protect our clothes, got wet out in the pouring rain
[00:30.05] The windshield wipers were no help at all, but they turned on anyway
[00:34.20] You smiled at me, and you said, "It's a perfect day"
[01:00.20] 
[00:40.27] I thought we wouldn't make it
[00:42.70] We tried to wait it out
[00:45.19] Under the gas station
[00:47.56] We parked and we made out
[00:50.38] For a couple minutes, then we went back on our route
[01:16.38] 
[00:59.17] Sometimes you gotta drive
[01:02.22] A convertible in the rain
[01:05.02] Move through the night
[01:07.17] Never pressing down on the brakes
[01:09.66] If we were to die
[01:12.25] I wouldn't mind going this way (oh, oh, oh)
[01:18.66] 'Cause I love you in the chaos
[01:21.01] And I don't care if we're safe
[01:23.96] Driving a convertible in the rain
[01:40.46] 
[01:28.58] Even though you tried, you couldn't quite keep your hands at ten and two
[01:33.66] I can't deny, I never tried to keep mine off of you
[01:38.25] We've been together for almost two years
[01:40.53] But tonight it feels brand new
[01:43.54] Maybe it's the t-shirt, how the rain glues it to you
[02:09.54] 
[01:48.80] I thought we wouldn't make it
[01:51.28] We tried to wait it out
[01:53.74] Under the gas station
[01:56.19] We parked and we made out
[01:58.83] For a couple minutes, then we went back on our route
[02:24.83] 
[02:07.68] Sometimes you gotta drive
[02:10.81] A convertible in the rain
[02:13.56] Move through the night
[02:15.65] Never pressing down on the brakes
[02:18.26] If we were to die
[02:20.72] I wouldn't mind going this way (oh, oh, oh)
[02:27.25] 'Cause I love you in the chaos
[02:29.53] And I don't care if we're safe
[02:44.53] 
[02:32.42] We're breezin' past the streetlights as if there's a storm to chase
[02:37.04] And I can recognize your love without looking at your face
[02:42.00] And we're never going back to where we were just yesterday
[02:46.20] But can we create this feeling every day?
[03:06.70] 
[02:56.61] Sometimes you gotta drive
[02:59.82] A convertible in the rain
[03:02.53] Move through the night
[03:04.79] Never pressing down on the brakes
[03:07.28] If we were to die
[03:09.77] I wouldn't mind going this way (oh, oh, oh)
[03:16.15] 'Cause I love you in the chaos
[03:18.50] And I don't care if we're safe
[03:21.53] Driving a convertible in the rain
[03:38.03] 
[03:24.74] (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
[03:25.96] (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
[03:36.09] (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
[03:40.38] (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
